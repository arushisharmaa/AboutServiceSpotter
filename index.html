 How to use this APP

ServiceSPOTTER is a app created by Arushi Sharma, a High School student volunteer.

This app helps Homeless and Low-Income communities connect to services using a mobile app where they can connect with various service providers e.g., Food, Clothing, Shelter, and Health care. The app currently has resources for Austin, Texas. Plans are in place to expand the services to Texas State and nation-wide. 

The App Users can access the app to get the following services:
 <ul>
<li> Explore details of any service provider to get details like contact info, transit directions and schedule for that service.  </li> 
<li> Obtain directions of the service provider from your location. </li> 
<li> Like any service or give comments on service </li> 
<li> Ability to request for any missing service providers </li>

<li> Interactive Chat Box Spotty to assist the users </li> 
<li> Volunteer opportunities </li>
